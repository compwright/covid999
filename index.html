<h1 class="display-4 my-4">&quot;999 new cases&quot;</h1>
<p class="lead my-4">In July 2020, a rumor started to circulate online that typing any three-digit number followed by the words &quot;new cases&quot; into Google would return news articles or other reports about COVID-19 in search results (<a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/google-any-3-digits-new-cases/">Snopes.com</a>).</p>
<p class="lead my-4">Is it true? Yes, it would seem. To test this, I wrote a quick little computer program to run a Google search and take the top result for every number from 1-999. See the results for yourself:</p>
